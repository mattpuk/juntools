Parse a Juniper SRX FW configuration (in XML format) and via Dot create graphs to vizualize relationships between policies, services and security zones. Sort of.

I created this project back in 2012 when Juniper didn't have a good MGMT tool (pre-Space) and i wanted a way to visualize a pretty complicated setup in regards to security/NAT policies and security zones.

#### Disclaimer

The script might not work with Junos 11.4+ or worse, not at all. I've added it to Github as a "note-to-self"! :)
